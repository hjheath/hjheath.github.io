          <h2>Henry Heath</h2>
          <p>I am a software engineer at Metaswitch Networks. I develop tools that automate the testing of telecoms software. Outside of work I enjoy working on my own projects which include building websites and using computers to do anything from solving maths problems to locating second hand cars.</p>
          <p>This website explains what I like working on, what my other interests are, and what I enjoyed learning at University. I hope it is more interesting and engaging than a traditional CV.</p>

      		<h3><a href="http://www.metaswitch.com/">Metaswitch Networks</a></h3>
      		<p>I develop tools that test our telecoms software. I write tools in Python and expose them to a team of testers through web apps written in Django, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
      		<p>During a company wide Hackathon I worked on applying machine learning algorithms to our internal bug tracking and customer issue databases. The hack has since been turned into an internal tool that support engineers use to find similar issues and therefore solve customers’ problems quickly. My team won the ‘Most Ambitious Hack’ prize for our efforts.</p>

      		<p>I try to be an active member of the software community. I attend meet ups such as <a href="http://www.manytomany.co.uk/">Many to Many</a> and the London Tester Gathering where I have heard interesting talks about the many different approaches to software development. I compete in <a href="http://www.roqit.co.uk/the-defectives">The Defectives</a> software testing competition, which is great fun.</p>
      		<p>I have watched talks by James Bach and Michael Bolton - the poster boys of software testing.</p>

          <h3>The Student White Tie Company</h3>
          <p>Whilst at University I co-founded a business hiring out White Tie to students for summer balls. My major contribution was to build the <a href="http://studentwhitetie.co.uk" target="_blank">website</a>. This was the first website I ever built, using only the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> courses on HTML and CSS.</p>
          <p>The business is successful, making a profit of over £2000 a year and is still being run by students at Oxford University.</p>

          <p>I design and build websites. My first website was for The Student White Tie Company. I have since created a website for a practising <a href="http://alisonleepsychotherapy.co.uk">psychologist</a> and I am currently helping to build the website for the Harvard LGBTQ conference 2016.</p>

    		<h3>Sport</h3>
    		<p>I have played rugby for New College Oxford, Teddington RFC and Hampstead RFC. I have also represented Oxfordshire at U20 and Oxford University at U21 level. On top of this I have completed the RFU Entry Level Referee Award and I am a member of the London Referee Society.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy cycling - I have climbed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Ventoux" target="_blank">Mont Ventoux</a> and hope to take on Alp d'Huez soon. However at present I make do with laps of Regent’s Park.</p>

        <h3>Weather and Climate Models</h3>
        <p>I studied Physics at New College for four years. I particularly enjoyed writing code to model dynamic systems such as the double pendulum. As a result I chose to do my master’s project in the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics sub-department modelling climate and weather systems.</p>
        <p>Together with my supervisor Peter Duben, I worked on improving the efficiency of weather and climate models. We reduced the number of bits used by a computer to represent floating point numbers and measured the precision and accuracy of the resulting forecasts. My results indicated that more than halving the number of bits in the mantissa has little effect on the reliability of forecasts. It is expected that hardware that operates at lower precision will lead to a corresponding reduction in the computational cost of making a forecast.</p>

        <h3>Gibbs Prize for Public Speaking</h3>
        <p>I won an Oxford speaking competition for a talk I gave on "The Physics of Bicycles". I tried to answer two questions: why bicycles stay up when you cycle with no hands, and why cyclists in the Tour de France do not pedal when descending.</p>
        <p>The answer to the first question is complicated, seemingly obvious answers such as gyroscopic effects have been discredited. Indeed <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fajans/Teaching/MoreBikeFiles/JonesBikeBW.pdf" target="_blank">David E. H. Jones</a> constructed and rode with no hands a bicycle with counter spinning wheels to cancel out any gyroscopic effects.</p>
        <p>Top cyclists achieve such high speeds when descending that it is more efficient to tuck their body and legs in to reduce drag than it is to pedal as can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR3QoZWMkok" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>The Chalet</h3>
        <p>At University I loved going on the annual reading party to the college <a href="http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/new-college-chalet">chalet</a> in the Alps. The chalet does not have electricity so we were forced to indulge in the simple pleasures of reading, walking and cooking.</p>
        <p>The chalet is located above the Chamonix valley in France, about two fifths of the way up Mount Blanc.</p>
